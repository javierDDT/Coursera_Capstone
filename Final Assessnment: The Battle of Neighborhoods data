5 Methodology:
He collected different sources of information such as locations, zip codes, geographic locations to import all this data into a Jupyter notebook.

The selection was based solely on the place of the restaurant or locations in Santiago, Chile, to filter the results that we use the "Metropolitan of Santiago" leaving a total of 52 locations, joined all bases, leaving a size of (52.4).

Information about sushi restaurants, schools, universities and offices was sought for each location obtain this information from Foursquare.

For each location we group and count each of the 4 categories, defined a weight for each category, depending on the recurrence you may have in our sushi restaurant, like:

• Sushi restaurant: -1 points (the more restaurants there are in a sector, the less important it’s to us) 
• Schools: 1 point (they are good clients, but it depends on the money their parents give them) 
• Universities: 2 points (they are good clients and with more economic independence than the students) 
• Offices: 3 points (they have their own income and could be frequent clients)

For each location we calculate a final score and order the resulting data from highest to lowest. The place with the highest score will be where we will put our sushi restaurant
